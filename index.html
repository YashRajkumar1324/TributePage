                <p>Paul William Walker IV was a famous American actor known for his daredevil roles and killer good looks. Walker was born in Glendale, California to an amateur boxer father and a fashion model mother. Walker was of Irish descent and a Virgo by all counts. He was the firstborn and had four younger siblings. Walker was raised a Latter-day Saint and grew up in Sunland, Los Angeles. He attended Village Christian School and graduated in 1991. He went to a community college in Southern California, majoring in marine biology.

                    Walker’s acting career began in 1984. He appeared in “CBS Schoolbreak Special,” a teen anthology series. He also made an appearance in the drama series “Highway to Heaven” from 1984 to 1986. By 1987, he had secured his first leading role as Jeremy Beatty in “Throb.” Walker continued featuring in sitcoms and received guest roles in “Charles in Charge, Who’s the Boss?” and “The Young and the Restless” in the early 90s. Walker got nominated for a Youth in Film Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Soap Opera for his performance in “The Young and the Restless.” Walker’s final role in television was on the “Statute of Limitations” episode of the 1996 show “Touched by an Angel.” Walker’s film career goes back to 1986. He got his first feature film role in “Meet the Deedles” (1998). Walker appeared in several films, including “Varsity Blues” (1999), “She’s All That” (1999), and “Skulls” (2000), before getting his breakthrough role in “The Fast and the Furious.” He won an MTV Movie Award for his role as Brian O’Conner in 2002 for ‘Best On-Screen Team’ — an award he shared with co-star Vin Diesel. He reprised this role in the 2003 sequel, “2 Fast 2 Furious,” and the following sequels before his demise. Walker had four films in which he starred, released posthumously. These films are “Hours” (2013), “Brick Mansions” (2014), “Pawn Shop Chronicles” (2013), and “Furious 7” (2015).
                    
                    Walker lived a great life, and he is missed every day by his friends, co-stars, and family. Before his demise, he was dating Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell. Walker died tragically in a car crash en route to a charity event in a Valencia neighborhood. He was in the car with Roger Rodas, and they were both burnt beyond recognition. He is survived by his daughter, Meadow Rain Walker, whom he had with his one-time girlfriend, Rebecca Soteros.</p>
